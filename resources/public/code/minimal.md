In this example the simplest case of using Tapkee is considered. For
the sake of simplicity, the input data is a one-dimensional range
of real values from 0.0 to 99.0 with step 1.0. The Multidimensional
Scaling (MDS) algorithm maps vectors using pairwise distances
(absolute differences between data points). The output is the
centered input data (i.e. 0.0 maps to -49.5 and 99.0 maps to 49.5).
